# The Real Essentials

> The unofficial upgrade of EssentialsX (**NOT BUILT ON ESSENTIALSX OR AFFILIATED IN ANY WAY**)

EssentialsX has come to have too many commands, some being replaced by plugins that work better. Others, being too OP, or completely random. This plugin is basically EssentialsX++!

## Commands (All)

## Built With

- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)
- [PaperMC API](https://papermc.io)

Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## How to Use

1. Download the plugin's JAR file.
2. Move the JAR file to your server's `plugins` folder. (If you do not have one, consider using [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/?utm=the-real-essentials-gh) as your software. You should be able to move over your player data and world files.)
3. Restart/start your server.
4. You do not need to set up permissions for the commands, unless you want to give certain people/groups admin access. All player commands are double-checked to make sure they do not impact core mechanics of the game, but only just enhance the parts mojang needs to add.
5. Use the commands provided [here](#commands-all).
6. Invite players. (They should know these commands, as most know the EssentialsX commands, which are similar)
7. Have fun!
